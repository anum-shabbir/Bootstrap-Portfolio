                            Hi, I am Anum Shabbir working as a Software QA Engineer at Decker IP (Medical Publisher). I joined this company October 2017
                            and my first job as QA engineer ever since I immigrated to Canada 3 years ago. I worked as an
                            IT and Database Engineer at Diamond Yarn of Canada before this for about 6 months.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-8 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
                        <p>
                            I have always been passionate about programming and working with code and developers. Recently I decided to step up and learn
                            to code myself too, and joined a BootCamp Course at UofT - This portfolio is part of the assignment
                            I am working on. I have worked with Java, C++ and Python, did little chunks of programming for
                            automation testing on Selenium. </p>
